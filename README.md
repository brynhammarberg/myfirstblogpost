### Art Piece 1

Homage to New York by Jean Tinguely was a piece of performance art constructed and partially demolished in 1960. The piece originally was a large sculpture composed of bicycle wheels, motors, a piano, an addressograph, a go-cart, a bathtub, and other objects. It was 23 feet long and 27 feet high and painted white. It was “set in motion” in front of a crowd at the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s sculpture garden, causing a balloon to rise, paintings to be made and destroyed, bottles to crash into the ground, and a number of other disruptive and destructive measures. It was only partially destroyed as the fire department put out a fire before it could be completed. Members of the crowd took some of the remains, some other pieces are in museums such as MoMA today, and the rest was thrown out. I was drawn to this because at first it may seem like a sculpture that simply falls apart, but on closer examination it created, destroyed, narrated, and rebuilt during its journey. It was meant to speak to the energy of New York City as a city which rebuilds itself time after time, and I think the way in which Tinguely approached that idea was incredibly unique and fascinating.
